# Where?

Where is a tool for finding friends with a compass tool directing the user to their friend. The project is currently paused this project for a day with more time. In its current state it operates in a MVP form, with the ability to share the users current location, and direct to another location via a compass UI.

The project is limited by the quality of the compass calibration which may be challenging to overcome. The biggest next step I see for this project is to implement real time sharing of locations between devices.

## Getting Started

To run the project [install flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) on your device and then execute

```flutter run```

from the home directory.

Enjoy!
